I enchanced my knowledge of code with codesters.  In addition to this, I learned about functions, loops, and x,y coordinates. 
Next week I would like to learn more about coding and sprites.
My goals for next week are to pick up code fasgter and be able to identify bugs even quicker than today. 
For my project I wouold like to create a fashion app or a game.
